# Steps
Here are the general steps you can follow to create a Tetris game in Python:

-    Set up the game window: Use a library like Pygame or Tkinter to create a window where the game will be displayed.

-    Design the game pieces: Each Tetris piece is made up of four blocks arranged in a specific shape. You will need to create a representation for each of the seven different Tetris pieces and a way to rotate them.

-    Implement the game mechanics: This includes handling the movement and rotation of the pieces, checking for completed lines, and updating the game state when a piece is placed.

-    Add controls: Allow the player to move and rotate the pieces using keyboard input.

-    Add scoring: Keep track of the player's score and increase it when they clear lines.

-    Add a level system: As the player clears more lines, the game should become progressively more difficult by increasing the speed at which the pieces fall.

-    Add visual effects: Enhance the game with animations, sound effects, and other visual flourishes.

-    Test and debug: Playtest the game and fix any bugs or issues that arise.
